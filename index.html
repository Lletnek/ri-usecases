      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <span><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a></span>, a user
        agent's <dfn>environmental conditions</dfn> are primarily expressed as
        CSS <dfn>media features</dfn> (e.g., max-width, orientation,
        monochrome, etc.) and CSS media types (e.g., print, screen, etc.). A
        <dfn>responsive image</dfn> is an image that a developer explicitly
        adapts in response to different <span>environmental conditions</span>:
        adaptations can include, but are not limited to, changing the width,
        height, or even the source of an image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media
        features</a> are dynamic in nature (e.g., a browser window is re-sized,
        a device is rotated from portrait to landscape, and so on), thus a user
        agent constantly responds to events that change the properties of media
        features. As a web page's layout adapts to changes in media features
        and media type, an image's ability to communicate effectively can be
        significantly reduced (e.g., images start to show compression artefacts
        as they are scaled to match the quality of media or some media
        feature). When this happens, developers rely on <span>responsive
        images</span> to present images at different resolutions, or even in
        different formats (e.g., swapping to SVG), to make sure their images
        continue communicating effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, as the number and varieties of high-density screens has
        increased (both on mobile and desktop devices), web developers have had
        to create custom techniques for serving images that best match a
        browser's <span>environmental conditions</span>. For a list of examples
        of the range of <dfn>techniques</dfn> in use in 2012, see Chris
        Coyier's article "<a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">Which
        responsive images solution should you use?</a>". These techniques have
        a number of shortcomings, which are discussed below (and these
        shortcomings serve as the motivation to reach out to the <a href=
        "http://w3.org">W3C</a> and <a href="http://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a> for
        standardization).
      </p>
      <p>
        In formulating the requirements, this document tries to be
        <em>neutral</em> - it is not predicated on any solution. The document
        only tries to describe the use cases and what the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> understands, from
        practice, would be needed to address the use cases in the form of
        <span>requirements</span>. The <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> expects that a
        technical specification can be created to formally address each of the
        <span>requirements</span> (i.e., the <dfn>solution</dfn>). To date, two
        such specifications are currently under development:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <cite><a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">The picture
          element: An HTML extension for responsive images</a></cite>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <cite><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">The srcset attribute:
          An HTML extension for adaptive images</a></cite>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the one hand, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">the `srcset`
        attribute</a> allows authors to define various image resources and
        “hints” that assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate
        image source to display. Given a set of image resources, the user agent
        has the option of either following or overriding the author’s
        declarations to optimize the user experience based on criteria such as
        <a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching">display
        density</a>, connection type, <a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#user-control-over-sources">user
        preferences</a>, and so on.
      </p>On the other hand, <a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">the
      `picture` element</a> defines conditions under which the browser should
      follow the author's intentions when selecting which resource to display.
      This includes image source sizes designed to align with layouts
      variations specified in CSS media queries ( see: <a href=
      "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#design-breakpoints">design
      breakpoints</a>, <a href=
      "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#matching-media-features-and-media-types">
      media features and types</a> and <a href=
      "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#relative-units">relative units</a>
      ) or content variations for increased clarity and focus based on the
      <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction">client’s
      display size</a>.
      <p>
        The two proposed solutions are not mutually exclusive: together they
        address the set of <cite><a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org">Use Cases and Requirements for
        Responsive Images</a></cite>.
